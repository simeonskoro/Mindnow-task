Frontend task
Hops&Barley
This document delivers information about the project that is required. The goal is to provide a
high-level overview and allow the candidate some freedom of choice in how he can implement
the project. The focus is on how the developer thinks, how he handles challenges, how he
approaches problem solving in general. Code quality and readability is a hygiene factor that will
be taken into consideration.
Introduction
You work as a freelance developer and last week you have just finished a big project for a huge
corporation that you have been working on for the past 2 years. You decided to scale down a bit
and as a next project find something a lot smaller and lighter, something that you can have fun
making. You notice an ad, it’s this company that is looking for someone to create an app for
them. The copy just says: “We need a search app that will list companies for the user” -
Hops&Barley.
Intrigued, you decide to give it a go and contact them...
The Project (H&B v1.0)
Your job is to write a simple search app named Hops&Barley. It’s an app that helps users find
breweries based on their search input, check some additional info for each individual brewery,
see it’s location on map (optional) and add the desired breweries to favourites.
Functionality needed
Home page should have the app logo and a search box where user can input his search term
Result page should list all the returned breweries with its:

- Name
- Brewery type
- City / State / Country
  When clicked on a list item, user should be show a page with following details:
- Brewery name
- Brewery type
- Brewery logo
- Brewery address
- Brewery phone number
- Brewery website url
- Map with its location (optional)
  If any of the data is not provided, do not show it of course.
  If the logo is not existing, show a placeholder image.
  User should be able to add the selected brewery to his favourites list.
  There should be a page with favourites so users can check them and remove them from the list
  if needed.
  Prerequisites
  Please use the latest React / React-Native / Flutter (will be stated in email).
  You are allowed to use any React / RN / Flutter packages.
  Code should be commented and at least some tests should be done.
  Basic design is ok.
  All the data should be stored locally.
  If state management is used it should be Mobx.
  For brewery search use Open Brewery DB: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/
  For brewery logo use Clearbit Logo API: https://clearbit.com/logo
  Limitations
  Structure
  You are given freedom in structuring your application. Consider the application as a whole,
  Hops&Barley, what would your App look like? You can consider this your pet-project and decide
  yourself how the structure would look like. The Stories above are guidelines and not strict rules
  that need to be followed.
  Database
  Consider the Data Stores that will be used and how the data will be structured inside the app.
  Best Practices should be followed.
  Optional Features
- Representative design - Beautify the basic Design with some nice looking CSS.
- Animation / Interaction improvements - You can consider what small animations can
  be added to make the app look and feel cooler.
  Review
  The code does not need to be complete or perfect. You can submit when you are comfortable
  enough for us to take a look at it. The main point of this assignment is to understand how well
  you write code, how you tackle unknown problems and how you think. Do not be afraid if
  everything is not perfect, it rarely is, but try to do your best to bring out a working solution.
  Working is better than perfect but non-working
